Based on the attached screenshot make a simple carousel application using API — https://retoolapi.dev/RrRljN/casinos

# Things to know:
* We haven’t included a design work file (xd, figma, psd) for a reason. We believe that pixel-perfect implementation can only be achieved by understanding the design process and not by reading specifications available in work files
* We won’t check for IE6 support, so we're saying a big YES to the usage of cutting-edge technologies available in modern browsers  (think Flexbox, CSS Grids, etc.)

# Requirements:
* Design should be recreated as closely as possible
* Responsive design (with at least three breakpoints — Desktop, Tablet, Phone)
* Working tab navigation and carousel
* The code should be well-formatted and semantically valid. Use one of the following guides: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript and http://mdo.github.io/code-guide/
* Share result in git

# Bonus points for:
* Lazy-loading images
* Using only Vanilla JS
